      "With Supertrue, if you get to 1,000 followers, you get $8,000. And you can directly message your fans.",
      "We do this by automatically creating numbered NFTs for your fans to mint of you. The numbered NFTs give fans a chance to show what day they first discovered your art. And if your fans later sell their NFT, you'll get 20% of the sale price.",
